  # Fast experiment allow the user to combine single replacements and make multiple
  # changes at the same time. Defining a policy is possible to check if the
  # experiment was successfull and keep changing the file using a specific
  # search.
  #
  # The experiment have a combination algorithm that recursively check what
  # combinations work with what combinations. It can delay years and because of
  # that it tries a first replacement targeting all the cases in a single file.
  #
  # You can define experiments and build experimental files to improve some code in
  # an automated way. Let's create a hook to check if a `before` or `after` block
  # is useless in a specific spec:
  #
  # @example
  #  Fast.experiment("RSpec/RemoveUselessBeforeAfterHook") do
  #    lookup 'some_spec.rb'
  #    search "(block (send nil {before after}))"
  #    edit {|node| remove(node.loc.expression) }
  #    policy {|new_file| system("bin/spring rspec --fail-fast #{new_file}") }
  #  end
  #
  # ## Example 2: use build_stubbed instead of create
  #
  # Let's say you want to try to automate some replacement of
  # `FactoryBot.create` to use `FactoryBot.build_stubbed`.
  #
  # For specs let's consider the example we want to refactor:
  #
  # @code
  #  let(:person) { create(:person, :with_email) }
  #
  # And the intent is refactor to use `build_stubbed` instead of `replace`:
  #
  # @code
  #  let(:person) { build_stubbed(:person, :with_email) }
  #
  # Here is the experiment definition:
  #
  # @example
  #  Fast.experiment('RSpec/ReplaceCreateWithBuildStubbed') do
  #    lookup 'spec'
  #    search '(block (send nil let (sym _)) (args) $(send nil create))'
  #    edit { |_, (create)| replace(create.loc.selector, 'build_stubbed') }
  #    policy { |new_file| system("bin/spring rspec --format progress --fail-fast #{new_file}") }
  #  end
